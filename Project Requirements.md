COMPUTER ORGANIZATION & ARCHITECTURE LAB (2016-17)
===============================================

**TERM PROJECT**

Take any real life computing machine like washing machine, microwave, smart watch etc. 

### PART A: ISA DESIGN
Design an ISA for an 8-bit machine which can handle all operations (atleast ten) of your machine. Your project report should contain the following:

1. **Introduction** (reference to the machine, description of functions, any other information which is required to design the ISA). 
2. **Specify the following:**
    * Memory model
    * Registers
    * Instruction format
    * Instruction design
    * Data types
    * Addressing modes
    * Instruction types
    * Flow of control handling


### PART B: ASSEMBLER DESIGN

1. Write a C program which will convert the mnemonic code of your machine (as defined in the above ISA) to its equivalent binary machine code.
2. Test your assembler for a specific scenario.

### PART C: MACHINE SIMULATION
1.	Write a C program to implement the designed ISA as a computing machine which takes binary machine instructions as an input and produces the final output.
a. Display status of registers, ALU control signals and flag register for each instruction execution. 

### PART D: MICROARCHITECTURE DESIGN

1.	Design the microarchitecture for your machine. Draw and specify control signals, bus architecture and ALU design.
